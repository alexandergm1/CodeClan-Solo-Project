# CodeClan-Solo-Project

To retrieve the files necessary to run the application, the user will need to locate
the repository on Github and clone it 

To access this web application, the user will require Flask and an internet browser. 
Once the user has cloned the application folder, they will need to ensure that Flask
is installed on their system (this can be completed by using pip3 Flask install in
the terminal).

Alternatively, the user can also paste the following into their terminal while inside
the folder they want to clone the files into:

"git clone git@github.com:alexandergm1/CodeClan-Solo-Project.git"


For this app, I used the following technologies:
  
 Flask,
 SQL,
 Python 3,
 HTML,
 CSS,
 Jinja
